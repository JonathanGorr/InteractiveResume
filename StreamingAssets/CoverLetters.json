The Game Design program consisted of rapidly prototyping small games in engines like Unity3d and Unreal. The Game Art program was dedicated to learning how to 3d model, animate and rig in 3ds max. It also compelled fluency in a host of Adobe products. Around that time, I interned as an Unreal Engine 3 level designer at Dominating Studios. I was responsible for building a metropolitan level for their multiplayer shooter, Critical Point Incursion. Afterwards, I completed my Unreal Engine 4 project, The Workshop, that is a 3d construction of a house’s basement interior. Post-graduation, I am nearing on 2 years of strong Unity3d engineering and 3d art experience. \n \n Creating, versioning (Perforce), and integrating assets into the proprietary game engine. Solving or forecasting design implementation problems cooperatively with artists, programmers and designers. Seeing as I have a considerable deal of experience creating houses and interiors, I am confident I can perform the needed tasks quickly and with high-quality results. I look forward to speaking with you to discuss the project in greater detail. Please feel free to contact me via email or a phone call (754 423 4462).\n\n —\nP.S.

Post-graduation, I have now 2 years of expert experience independently developing games in Unity3d. \n \n For 17 past recent months, I have been employed as a Technical Artist at Sparkypants—a Baltimore-based game studio. As Technical artist I was tasked to create, version and integrate game assets into the proprietary engine using JSON databases, solve or forecast design implementation problems and perform gameplay and usability tests for their acclaimed title, DropZone. I learned much about the waterfall software design cycle, efficient project management and collaborative studio development.\n\nWith these skills and work experience in mind, I am confident that I can tackle any challenges this responsibility may present.

I am confident my education and past work experience have made me highly capable to assume the responsibilities this role assumes.\n\nAt the Maryland Institute College of Art, I achieved my BA in Interactive Arts, majoring in Game Design and minoring in Game Art. The program consisted of rapidly prototyping small games in engines like Unity3d(C#) and Unreal Engine(Blueprint) for mobile and desktop platforms. The program focused on designing novel as well as conventional gameplay systems and mechanics then implementing them using appropriate software design patterns. We were also compelled to properly version-control our projects for collaboration purposes using Git then document them for academic review and portfolio incorporation. Coming from a somewhat holistic creative program, I learned to appreciate the game production process from art, design and programmatic perspectives.\n\nI have been most recently employed as a Technical Artist at Sparkypants LLC., located in Baltimore, Maryland. My responsibility as Technical Artist included:\n\n1.Generating, versioning, and integrating assets into the proprietary game engine.\n2.Solving or forecasting implementation problems with artists, programmers and designers.\n3.Performing UX tests and playtests then reporting this data for daily production discussions.\n\nAt Sparkypants I learned a lot about team communication, the “waterfall” software design process and project management – using apps like Trello and Favro -- to assist in meeting production deadlines and milestones.\n\nI happen to be a long-time fan of the Worms franchise, and I was delighted to have met some rockstars like Grant Kirkhope and Team 17 members at GDC this year at the Xbox party. I’d like to close by congratulating Team 17 and its partner on the reception of Yooka-Laylee and I wish the team luck in all its endeavors.
